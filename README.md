## Instructions

### Environment

1. ```conda create -n DHY1H pyside2```
2. ```conda activate DHY1H```
3. ```pip install opencv-python-headless matplotlib numpy pillow```
4. Clone <a href="https://github.com/mahir1010/Heterodimer-Y1H-Analysis">https://github.com/mahir1010/Heterodimer-Y1H-Analysis</a>
5. Configure path to include above repository
   
<small>The headless version of OpenCV is required to launch QT based GUIs. May need to uninstall regular ```opencv-python```.</small>

### Launch
1. ```conda activate DHY1H```
2. ```python DHY1H-Viewer.py```
